**Hey, I'm Caleb Vicente!** :smile:

I am a Data Scientist working in a multinational consulting company. After finishing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Telecommunications Engineering in the Spring of 2020, I realized that math and data were my passions. After years working in the sector and seeing all the new trents in the field, I can do nothing but encourage students and enterpreneurs to deeply explore what I consider is the next step of evolution: Artificial Intelligence.

**Now I'm focusing on**

Currently, I am collaborating with Open Source communities to make the latest Artificial Intelligence trents available to everyone.
